Okay, so here is the flow:
1. Go to the root of the project folder

2. Download the dataset under the 'data' folder

3. Rename the train.txt, test.txt and valid.txt in the dataset to original_train.txt, original_test.txt, original_valid.txt respectively

4. Create a new folder called 'testdata' and 'traindata' at the ROOT of the project (IMP)

5. Run the script (Note the 2 required arguments): python helper/create_major_task.py <% of original dataset, eg. 80, 90, etc.> <Dataset, (eg. FB15K-237)>. This will create files such as "new_train.txt", "new_test.txt", etc at the ROOT of the project. This is done to ensure we do not overwrite any files accidentally. Now copy these files to the "data/<dataset_name>/" folder and rename them to "train.txt", "valid.txt" and "test.txt". This is our major task set that we just created and installed.

6. Now from the ROOT again, run: python helper/create_minor_tasks_v2.py <# of timesteps> <train/test> <datasetname>. This will create the minor task files in the "testdata" folder at the root if test is provided. Else it will create in the traindata folder

7. Let me know if you have any clarifications

8. Once the files are created, just move the "testdata" or "traindata" folder to the dataset folder under "data/"

9. example:
<% of original dataset>: 90
<# of timesteps> for train: 500
<# of timesteps> for test: 1000
